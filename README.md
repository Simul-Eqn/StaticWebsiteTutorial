# StaticWebsiteTutorial
Practice updating a website, and see your changes live!! This is actually more of a GitHub practice than website practice :) 


Link to website: 
TODO 

Please go to that website to request push access to this GitHub Repository. 



## Explanation of folder struture 
In the directory of the repository, there will be 6 files: 
* README.md -- this file 
* Instructions to update website.txt -- some text instructions that may be useful 
* .gitignore -- a file that will specify files to, by default, not be looked at by Git. 
* .gitattributes -- a file that git uses to store information about the repository. It's kind of not committed to GitHub 
* index.html -- the file that specifies the main page that people see when they go to the website 
* index.css -- the stylesheet used by index.html (in the ```<head>``` tag)
